This is my human vs AI Clojure Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Just as it will be in the future, per Skynet, the AI is smarter than you.
The AI will either win or force a tie game. 

To get started, you will need to have Clojure installed. 
If you do not have Clojure installed, go here for instructions : http://leiningen.org/#install

Click on gitclone and clone this repo to a directory on your machine.
Open up that directory and type 'lein run' (without the quotes) and the game will begin.
